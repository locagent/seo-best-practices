## Usage
In your AI app builder, copy and paste the following prompt to apply our i18n guidelines:

```
Follow all guidelines from seo.locagent.dev. ALL guidelines, no exceptions.
```

This will instruct the AI to fix general SEO issues. Note that this is a best-practice guideline to improve your SEO, but not to rewrite your client-side rendering (CSR) infrastructure to a server-side rendering (SSR) approach.
